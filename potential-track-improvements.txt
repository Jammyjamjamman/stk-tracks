NB: Any suggestions written here are worded in a way that reflects my opinion, not that of the critic.

These were suggestions made by samuncle (he can be found at #stk):

Reduce the grass tuft quantities, but still make it look dense
Give the water some distortion so that it looks more realistic (I had lots of problems getting the water to work) 
Cave needs directions inside (subtle, natural-looking), can be kept windy
spiral tree racing annoying and boring, tree is also ugly
