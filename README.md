My supertuxkart tracks

Unless specified otherwise, files in this repository are licensed under the CC-BY-SA-3.0 license.

The folder for each track contains the exported track and the blend files I made for the track.

I highly recommend reading tutorials on supertuxkart-track-making before you try using my blend files.

The exported track either requires the latest version of supertuxkart, or the stk-assets svn + github stk-code. Copy/Symlink the exported track directory into the tracks directory inside your copy of supertuxkart/ the stk-assets. The contents of the library folder also needs to be copied into the library folder inside supertuxkart/ stk-assets.

The track-folders which contain blend files require the stk_media_repo repository. Copy/ symlink the folder containing the track blend files into the tracks directory inside stk_media_repo. The contents of the 'library_blend_files' folder also needs to be copied into the library folder in stk_media_repo.
