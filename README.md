My supertuxkart tracks

The folder for each track contains the exported track and the blend files.

The exported track either requires the latest version of supertuxkart, or the stk-assets svn. Symlink the exported track directory to the tracks directory inside your copy of stk/ stk-assets.

The folder containing blend files requires stk_media_repo to be used. Symlink the blend-files-folder into the tracks directory inside stk_media_repo.
